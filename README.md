# predict-employee-attrition

## Employee-Attrition - Classification
This project is a machine learning classification problem. The objective of this project was to predict the rate of employee attrition in the current scenario based on different features. It was the classification problem. I applied three classification algorithms (Logistics, Decision Tree & Random Forest). But I got high accuracy score about 0.92 using Logistic Regression.
