# predict-employee-attrition

## Employee-Attrition - Classification
This project is a machine learning classification problem. The objective of this project was to predict the rate of employee attrition in the current scenario based on different features. It was the classification problem. I applied three classification algorithms (Logistics, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Neural Network, Boosting Tree Extreme). But I got 0.82 AUC using Logistic Regression.

## Steps:
1. Data Exporatory and analysis

2. Feature engineering

3. Model training and performance evaluations

4. Feature importance analysis
